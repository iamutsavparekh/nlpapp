# NLP Application

## Overview
This Spring Boot application performs NLP (Natural Language Processing) analysis on uploaded text files, comparing them with precomputed aggregated statistics.

## Features
- Upload text files and perform NLP analysis.
- Compare the results with aggregated statistics.
- Web interface built with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nlpapp.git
cd nlpapp
```

### What Was Done

### 1. Controller Enhancement
- **Business Logic in Controller**: Implemented the core NLP functionality directly within the `NLPController`. This includes the logic for calculating NLP statistics, loading aggregated results, and comparing these statistics.
- **Logging Improvements**: Enhanced the logging within the controller to provide detailed information about the processing of uploaded files, including logging the content length and the calculated statistics.
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling in the controller, ensuring that users are notified if something goes wrong during file processing, such as issues with reading the file or generating statistics.

### 2. Frontend and Interface Improvements
- **Thymeleaf Templates**: Created and updated Thymeleaf templates (`index.html` and `result.html`) to provide a clean and user-friendly interface for uploading files and viewing NLP analysis results.
- **Inline CSS Styling**: Added inline CSS styles to the HTML templates to enhance the visual presentation of the web pages, making the interface more appealing and easier to navigate.

### 3. Documentation and Repository Setup
- **Updated README**: Updated the `README.md` file to include comprehensive instructions on setting up and running the application, an overview of the features, and detailed steps for installing and using the application.
- **Project Overview**: Provided an overview of the applicationâ€™s functionality, including the purpose of the NLP analysis and how the results are compared with aggregated statistics.

### 4. Git Repository Management
- **Version Control**: Committed all changes to the existing Git repository, ensuring that the work is properly tracked and documented.
- **Repository Structure**: Organized the repository to make it easy for others to clone, build, and contribute to the project, including clear instructions in the `README.md`.
